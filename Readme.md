# Machine Learning Basics

This aims to take a step by step implementation on how to get to a transformer architecture and explore what is required to implement a neural network algorithm from scratch.

This will explore:
- perceptron as the building block to teach it how to do AND gate operations
- multi layered perceptron to fix some issues with single layer perceptron
