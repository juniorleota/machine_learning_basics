# Jargons
These list out jargons that I see alot around neural network documentations.

output
- can refer to output layer or output function for neuron (refer to below for each associated jargon)

output layer
- L(O)

ouput function
- note: not really refered to implicitly just refered to in formula form
- output = previous layer to current layer weights * activation of previous layer + layer_bias
- z = w(l) * a(l-1) + b_l

linear output
- Zi
- 


predicted output
- y_pred

expected_output
- label
- y
- ouput neuron activation
- a_o or a(o) (activation for output)

vector
- vec

matrix
- mat
